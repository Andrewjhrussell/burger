# Title:

Burger App

# Badges

# Description

In this assignment, I create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM . This App has the following MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

# Installation

MySQL, Heroku, Node,

# Usage

This Website lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database
